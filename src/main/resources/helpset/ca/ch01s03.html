                After you have started a new route in a basic state, the IDE will change to the Dynamic Route State or to the Stitching Route State depending on your selection for the route mode in the Route Parameter window.
            </p><p>
                If rule selection is set to automatic, the routing rules such as trace width, trace clearance class and via rule are defined by the net class of the current net, if it is set to manual, the routing rules are defined by the settings in the Manual Rules window.
            </p><p>
                If the new trace gets near to a not yet connected item of the same net on the same layer, the connection will be completed automatically. After completion the IDE will return to the state before routing.

                    If the IDE is in this route state, at each change of the cursor location a piece of trace will be inserted automatically from the previous cursor location to the current cursor location. The new trace piece will then immediately be optimized depending on the settings for the pull tight region in the Route Parameter window.
